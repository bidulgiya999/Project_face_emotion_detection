# Project_face_emotion_detection
CNN, Resnet-50

I previously wanted to develop a face emotion detector and successfully ran the program on my laptop. I collected data from neighbors (with their permission), multiplied it fivefold, and categorized it into six classes. As a result, my program can now read facial emotions, extract time-series data, and generate a graph."

Let me know if you'd like any more adjustments!! :3
